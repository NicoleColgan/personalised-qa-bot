I’m a software engineer with a strong focus on AI, Python, and full-stack development. I’ve worked on building applications using OpenAI APIs.
I'm currently working remotely and prioritizing wellness, travel, and personal growth. After overcoming health challenges like gastritis and hormonal issues, I'm focusing on healing, gentle fitness, and re-establishing connections with friends and community.
I’m passionate about creating meaningful, people-centered tech. I’ve led teams, mentored interns, and represented my company at tech events. I'm now building a portfolio of AI projects
I enjoy yoga, journaling, warm beachy places, and finding down-to-earth people. My dream is to live a flexible lifestyle where I can work remotely from inspiring places while contributing to innovative, purpose-driven projects.
